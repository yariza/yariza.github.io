# Projects

## _Kaze (The Wind)_

I collaborated with violinist and composer Mari Kimura for her work, for violin, voice, string quartet, and interactive computer. I wrote code for the visual component of the piece, a representation of "wind" that flowed and morphed with the piece, using motion data tracked from specially made gloves worn by the performers. Max/MSP and Jitter were used for the live rendering of the particles.

## _Vango_ – Painterly Representations of Images

10/2015

We convert photographs of scenery into painting representations. After analysis of the image, a "canvas" file is outputted by the program, given a specific "style" file for _vango_ to paint in. After this, the painting can be rendered in either a textured or untextured format.

This project was written in C++, and uses the OpenCV framework.

## _Rainborg_ – Position-based Fluid Simulation

05/2015

Yujin Ariza, Eszter Offertaler

We implemented a GPU-accelerated position-based fluid simulation, based on the paper by [Miles Macklin, and Matthaias Muller](http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf). The program is capable of simulating and rendering the output at realtime speeds, for a number of particles up to 30,000.

This project was written in CUDA C/C++.
