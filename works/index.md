I am a computer science and music student interested in the intersection of Computer Graphics, Human Computer Interaction, and music performance. I am passionate about creative extensions of technology used in art form.

# Education

**Columbia University**  
_Bachelor of Arts, Computer Science_  
Columbia-Juilliard Exchange Program Participant

**The Juilliard School**  
_Master of Music, Violin Performance_  
As a student in the Columbia-Juilliard Exchange program, I had
the opportunity to take study violin at Juilliard, while taking classes at Columbia. I am currently studying full-time as a Masters student, with anticipated graduation in June 2017.

# Projects

## _Cracked Orlando_

03/2017

I contributed interactive art for the Juilliard production of _Cracked Orlando_, a multimedia performance piece by composer Jonathan Dawe. I was responsible for two elements in the show: a rotating and evolving "orb" which was projected as a hologram and controlled by an array of proximity sensors; and a virtual avatar of the character Alcina, motion-tracked by Kinect and augmented with particle effects.

## _Kaze (The Wind)_

I collaborated with violinist and composer Mari Kimura for her work, for violin, voice, string quartet, and interactive computer. I wrote code for the visual component of the piece, a representation of "wind" that flowed and morphed with the piece, using motion data tracked from specially made gloves worn by the performers. Max/MSP and Jitter were used for the live rendering of the particles.

## _Fluid_

12/2015

Fluid is an audiovisual piece that I created. The piece was made using Ableton Live + Max, so that the visuals (built in Max's Jitter) can react to the MIDI and control parameters being sent through Ableton. Read more about the project and its technical challenges in a blog post I wrote [here](/blog/2015/12/23/postmortem-fluid/).

## _Vango_ – Painterly Representations of Images

10/2015

We convert photographs of scenery into painting representations. After analysis of the image, a "canvas" file is outputted by the program, given a specific "style" file for _vango_ to paint in. After this, the painting can be rendered in either a textured or untextured format.

This project was written in C++, and uses the OpenCV framework.

## _Rainborg_ – Position-based Fluid Simulation

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yariza/Rainborg/master/results/grid-dambreak.png)

05/2015

Yujin Ariza, Eszter Offertaler

We implemented a GPU-accelerated position-based fluid simulation, based on the paper by [Miles Macklin, and Matthaias Muller](http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf). The program is capable of simulating and rendering the output at realtime speeds, for a number of particles up to 30,000.

This project was written in CUDA C/C++.
