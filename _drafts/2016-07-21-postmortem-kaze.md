In one of my classes as a first-year grad student in Juilliard, I helped build visuals for my teacher, [Mari Kimura](http://www.marikimura.com/) – violinist and composer extraordinaire, pioneer in all things interactive music, and master of _violin subharmonics_ (Check out her videos [Subharmonics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0dgtW49wNs), [Guitarbotana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNzL75a_dD8)). Mari created a piece entitled _Kaze_, for Violin, Voice, and String Quartet – augmented with wearable motion sensors, audio effects, and video projection – and asked if I could contribute interactive visuals to the project. I happily obliged!
