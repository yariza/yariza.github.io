Hi.

I'm Yujin Ariza. I write code, and I play the violin. Sometimes, I do things that try to bridge those two realms of study.

The primary purpose of a blog, one might say, is to document. Others might argue that it is to entertain, to educate, to aid in a pursuit of some great humanitarian cause, or to help define one's own intellectual and emotional growth. Some more others might assert that the purpose is to market one's achievements; to advertise and to show off, so that one has projects and opinions published on the internet, for the public to consume, for the job recruiter to critique.

I'm currently a student in the Masters program at Juilliard. My major is Violin Performance, but I try to explore the field of interactive music as it relates to technology.
